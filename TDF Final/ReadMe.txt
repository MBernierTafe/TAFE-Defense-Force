INSTRUCTIONS


USER INTERFACE:

WASD keys to move camera around, Mousewheel up and down to change zoom level. 

'Idle' button turns off any of the other modes if they're on and you don't wanna be there anymore.
'Place Tower' button is kinda superfluous, don't worry about it. 
'Upgrade Tower' button lets you upgrade the next tower on the map that you click on.  Upgraded towers are gilded in the finest of plain yellows.
'Sell Tower' button lets you sell the next tower on the map that you click.
'Return To Main Menu' returns to the main menu.  I know, I know.

Spacebar is a shortcut to enter Place mode using a Basic tower. Click on a white tower base to build there.

The buttons along the bottom select different tower types and automatically enter Place mode for that tower. Upg refers to the upgrade price, but upgrades are handled through the 'upgrade tower' button, not the tower type button.

TOWERS:

Basic Tower shoots a laser shot at a fairly regular pace. Upgraded, will hit harder.
Machine Gun Tower shoots weaker laser at a rapid pace and a shorter range than Basic.  Upgraded, will hit harder and shoot slightly further.
Sniper Tower shoots a powerful, long range shot at a slow pace.  Upgraded will hit harder and shoot farther.
Pulse Tower emits an AOE field around it every few seconds, damaging all enemies in the area.  Upgraded hits harder.
Rocket Tower shoots missles that explode into splash damage, damaging any nearby enemies.  Upgraded fires twice as fast.

Next Wave starts the next wave and can only be activated when all enemies are defeated.  


ENEMIES:

Purple tanks are Basic enemies. The template from which all enemies are built.
Red tanks are Buster enemies, similar to basic but with slightly more health.
Green tanks are Tank enemies, slow but with tons of health.
Yellow tanks are Swarm enemies, super fast but with no health.
White tanks are Boss enemies.  Similar to Basic tanks but with obscene health values.

Every enemy will deal One Life of damage upon contact with your base, and you only get 4 hits per stage! Be careful!

TIPS AND TRICKS

Towers cannot be placed if they'll completely block off the enemy pathfinding.  Of course, if an enemy is too close to find it's way back to a clear path when you place a valid tower that blocks it's current route...

Your score is determined by your final Gold count when a level is won.  Boss enemies are worth tons of gold but may be hard to kill, but hey, as long as you have more than 1 Life left, who needs glory, right? Right?

Quick fingered strategists might even be able to sell unneeded towers in time to finish a level with a slight score boost...

Quite often the first wave is the trickiest, but careful planning with your limited start resources should always see you through to the end!
